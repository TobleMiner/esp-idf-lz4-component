LZ4 esp-idf component
=====================

This component is a simple wrapper for https://github.com/lz4/lz4

# MCU optimized defaults

By default this wrapper configures LZ4 to be using as little RAM as possible. This can degrade achievable compression ratio.  
Please see `CMakeLists.txt` for further detais.

# Licensing

Please feel free to consider this wrapper license free as it does not contain any sufficiently creative elements to be protectable.  
For cases where a license is required for legal or compliance reasons consider this wrapper licensed under MIT or BSD 2-Clause license.
